A discord.js bot template already containing music functions\
You can add to this bot by writing your own commands code and putting in the commands folder

## Requirements

- NodeJS
- FFmpeg

### NodeJS

You are required to have NodeJS installed.\
If you do not have NodeJS installed, download it at <https://nodejs.org/> and run the installer.
Once installed, open your command line and run `node -v` to check if it has been properly installed.

### FFmpeg

You are required to have FFmpeg installed on your machine to play music.\
If you do not have FFmpeg installed, download it at <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>.

Extract the downloaded files into your C: drive and set up your `PATH` environment variable to the
`bin` folder. Once you have done this, close and reopen your command line if you already have it
opened and run `ffmpeg -version` to check if it has been properly installed.

## Command File Template

Make sure you follow the `help` object's syntax! It is very important for the `help` command to detect
the information of your command!

The way I did it in my code:

```js
module.exports.execute = async (client, message, args) => {
    // Commad code in here
}

module.exports.help = {
    name: "", // The name of the command
    aliases: [], // Add aliases inside the array
    category: "", // Specify which category this command belongs to
    usage: "", // Specify the arguments taken by the command
    description: "" // A short description about your command
}
```

Alternative:

```js
module.exports = {

    execute: async (client, message, args) => {
        // Commad code in here
    },

    help: {
        name: "", // The name of the command
        aliases: [], // Add aliases inside the array
        category: "", // Specify which category this command belongs to
        usage: "", // Specify the arguments taken by the command
        description: "" // A short description about your command
    }

}
```
